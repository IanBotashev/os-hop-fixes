# OS Hop Fixes
Mainly a personal tool for my endless reinstalls of my linux distro.

## Current tools:
### nautilus_bookmark_fix
De-elevates the default bookmarks in nautilus to allow them to be edited from the GUI explorer

### fix_i2c_nvidia
Attempts to fix the pesky "i2c timeout error" on boot by blacklisting the i2c driver.
